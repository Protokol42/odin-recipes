    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Fried Rice is the ultimate comfort food and a masterclass in culinary
      efficiency, traditionally designed to transform leftover "day-old" rice
      into a savory, texturally exciting meal. The secret to its signature taste
      lies in the high-heat "wok hei" (breath of the wok), which lightly toasts
      the grains while they toss with aromatics, crisp vegetables, and scrambled
      eggs.
    </p>

    <p>
      This version is a classic vegetable-forward base that is highly
      customizable. It balances the deep umami of soy sauce and toasted sesame
      oil with the brightness of fresh green onions. Whether served as a side
      dish or a standalone main, it's a fast, high-energy dish that rewards
      quick stirring and a hot pan.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>3 cups cooked jasmine rice (preferably day-old and chilled)</li>
      <li>2 tbsp vegetable oil (divided)</li>
      <li>2 large eggs (lightly beaten)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup frozen peas and carrots (thawed)</li>
      <li>1 small white onion (finely diced)</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
      <li>1 tsp fresh ginger (grated)</li>
      <li>3 tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tbsp oyster sauce (optional)</li>
      <li>1 tsp toasted sesame oil</li>
      <li>1/4 tsp white pepper</li>
      <li>2 stalks green onions (thinly sliced)</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp sugar</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt (to taste)</li>
      <li>1 tsp butter (optional for extra richness)</li>
      <li>1 tsp toasted sesame seeds (for garnish)</li>
      <li>Red chili flakes (optional for heat)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Prep the Rice:</strong> If the rice is clumped together, use
        clean hands or a fork to gently break the cold rice apart into
        individual grains before you start cooking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Scramble the Eggs:</strong> Heat 1/2 tablespoon of oil in a
        large wok or skillet over medium-high heat. Pour in the eggs and
        scramble quickly until just set. Remove from the pan and set aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sauté Aromatics:</strong> Wipe the pan clean if needed and add
        the remaining oil. Add the diced onion and sauté for 2 minutes until
        translucent. Stir in the garlic and ginger, cooking for 30 seconds until
        fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Flash Fry Vegetables:</strong> Toss in the peas and carrots.
        Stir-fry for 1 to 2 minutes until they are heated through and slightly
        softened.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Big Toss:</strong> Turn the heat to high. Add the rice to
        the pan. Stir-fry constantly for 3 to 4 minutes, pressing the rice down
        against the hot surface to toast the grains.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Seasoning:</strong> Pour in the soy sauce, oyster sauce, sesame
        oil, white pepper, and sugar. Toss everything together until the rice is
        evenly coated and steaming hot.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Final Finish:</strong> Fold the scrambled eggs back into the
        rice along with the green onions (and the optional pat of butter). Toss
        for one more minute.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Garnish:</strong> Taste for salt, then serve immediately topped
        with sesame seeds.
      </li>
    </ol>
