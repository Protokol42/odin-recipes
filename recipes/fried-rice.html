    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Fried Rice is the ultimate comfort food and a masterclass in culinary
      efficiency, traditionally designed to transform leftover "day-old" rice
      into a savory, texturally exciting meal. The secret to its signature taste
      lies in the high-heat "wok hei" (breath of the wok), which lightly toasts
      the grains while they toss with aromatics, crisp vegetables, and scrambled
      eggs.
    </p>

    <p>
      This version is a classic vegetable-forward base that is highly
      customizable. It balances the deep umami of soy sauce and toasted sesame
      oil with the brightness of fresh green onions. Whether served as a side
      dish or a standalone main, it's a fast, high-energy dish that rewards
      quick stirring and a hot pan.
