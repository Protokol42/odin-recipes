    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Sausage Rabokki is a hearty, amplified version of the classic Korean
      Tteokbokki. By combining "Ramyeon" (ramen noodles) and "Tteokbokki" (rice
      cakes), then adding sliced cocktail sausages, this dish transforms from a
      light snack into a filling, savory meal. The sausages add a smoky, salty
      depth to the sauce that balances the intense heat of the gochujang.
    </p>

    <p>
      The magic of Rabokki lies in the sauce reduction; as the ramen noodles
      cook directly in the spicy broth, they absorb the liquid, becoming
      incredibly flavorful while thickening the sauce into a rich glaze. It's a
      messy, glossy, and deeply satisfying dish that represents the best of
      modern Korean "soul food."
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>1 lb cylindrical rice cakes</li>
      <li>1 pack instant ramen noodles (discard the flavor packet)</li>
      <li>5 cocktail sausages (sliced into rounds)</li>
      <li>2 1/2 cups water</li>
      <li>2 tbsp gochujang (Korean red chili paste)</li>
      <li>1 tbsp sugar</li>
      <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
      <li>1 tsp minced garlic</li>
      <li>1 stalk green onion (chopped)</li>
      <li>1/2 tbsp gochugaru (Korean chili flakes)</li>
      <li>1 tsp sesame oil</li>
      <li>1 hard-boiled egg</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Soak the Cakes:</strong> Soak the rice cakes in lukewarm water
        for about 10 minutes to ensure they cook evenly without cracking.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Create the Base:</strong> In a large skillet, bring the 2 1/2
        cups of water to a boil. Stir in the gochujang, sugar, soy sauce,
        garlic, and gochugaru until the sauce base is a smooth, vibrant red.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Simmer Aromatics:</strong> Add the soaked rice cakes and the
        sliced sausages to the boiling liquid. Let them simmer for about 5
        minutes until the rice cakes start to soften.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Add the Ramen:</strong> Place the dry ramen noodle block
        directly into the center of the pan. As the noodles soften, use a fork
        or chopsticks to gently pull them apart so they are fully submerged in
        the sauce.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>The Reduction:</strong> Cook for another 3 to 4 minutes. The
        starch from the noodles and rice cakes will thicken the sauce
        significantly.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Final Toss:</strong> Once the noodles are tender, add the
        chopped green onions and the hard-boiled egg. Stir gently to coat
        everything in the glaze.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Serve:</strong> Turn off the heat and stir in the sesame oil for
        a glossy finish. Serve immediately in a shallow bowl.
      </li>
    </ol>
