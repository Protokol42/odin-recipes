    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
      Sausage Rabokki is a hearty, amplified version of the classic Korean
      Tteokbokki. By combining "Ramyeon" (ramen noodles) and "Tteokbokki" (rice
      cakes), then adding sliced cocktail sausages, this dish transforms from a
      light snack into a filling, savory meal. The sausages add a smoky, salty
      depth to the sauce that balances the intense heat of the gochujang.
    </p>

    <p>
      The magic of Rabokki lies in the sauce reduction; as the ramen noodles
      cook directly in the spicy broth, they absorb the liquid, becoming
      incredibly flavorful while thickening the sauce into a rich glaze. It's a
      messy, glossy, and deeply satisfying dish that represents the best of
      modern Korean "soul food."
