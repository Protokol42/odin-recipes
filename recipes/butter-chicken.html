    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Butter Chicken, traditionally known as Murgh Makhani, is a hallmark of
      Indian cuisine known for its incredibly rich, creamy, and mildly spicy
      tomato-based sauce. The dish features tender pieces of chicken that are
      often marinated in a blend of yogurt and aromatic spices before being
      simmered in a velvet-like gravy finished with generous amounts of butter
      and heavy cream.

      This recipe strikes a perfect balance between the acidity of tomatoes and
      the richness of the dairy, accented by the earthy aroma of dried fenugreek
      leaves (kasuri methi). It is an approachable favorite for those new to
      Indian flavors while remaining a staple for connoisseurs, best served
      alongside warm garlic naan or fragrant basmati rice to soak up every drop
      of the sauce.
