    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Butter Chicken, traditionally known as Murgh Makhani, is a hallmark of
      Indian cuisine known for its incredibly rich, creamy, and mildly spicy
      tomato-based sauce. The dish features tender pieces of chicken that are
      often marinated in a blend of yogurt and aromatic spices before being
      simmered in a velvet-like gravy finished with generous amounts of butter
      and heavy cream.
    </p>

    <p>
      This recipe strikes a perfect balance between the acidity of tomatoes and
      the richness of the dairy, accented by the earthy aroma of dried fenugreek
      leaves (kasuri methi). It is an approachable favorite for those new to
      Indian flavors while remaining a staple for connoisseurs, best served
      alongside warm garlic naan or fragrant basmati rice to soak up every drop
      of the sauce.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1.5 lbs boneless, skinless chicken thighs (bite-sized pieces)</li>
      <li>1/2 cup plain Greek yogurt</li>
      <li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 tsp turmeric</li>
      <li>1 tsp cumin</li>
      <li>1 tsp garam masala</li>
      <li>2 tbsp unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 tbsp vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 large onion (finely diced)</li>
      <li>1 tbsp ginger paste</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic (minced)</li>
      <li>15 oz tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>1 tsp chili powder</li>
      <li>1 tsp ground coriander</li>
      <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 tsp dried fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi)</li>
      <li>Fresh cilantro for garnish</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Marinate the Chicken:</strong> In a medium bowl, combine the
        chicken pieces with yogurt, lemon juice, and the marinade spices. Cover
        and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, though overnight is preferred
        for the best texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sear the Chicken:</strong> Heat the oil in a large skillet over
        medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces in batches, browning them on
        all sides. They do not need to be cooked through yet. Remove and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sauté Aromatics:</strong> In the same skillet, melt the butter.
        Add the diced onions and cook until softened and translucent. Stir in
        the ginger and garlic pastes, sautéing for about one minute until
        fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Simmer the Sauce:</strong> Pour in the tomato sauce and the
        remaining spices (chili powder and coriander). Lower the heat and let
        the sauce simmer for about 10 to 15 minutes, allowing the flavors to
        meld and the sauce to thicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Combine and Cream:</strong> Add the browned chicken back into
        the skillet. Stir in the heavy cream and the dried fenugreek leaves. Let
        everything simmer gently for another 5 to 10 minutes until the chicken
        is fully cooked through and the sauce is rich and glossy.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Garnish and Serve:</strong> Taste and add salt as needed.
        Garnish with a handful of fresh cilantro and serve immediately over rice
        or with naan.
      </li>
    </ol>
